---

#### Installing Dependencies on Windows

To easily install all required dependencies on Windows, we recommend using **MinGW** to have access to the **g++** compiler.
Don't forget to install **make**, **cmake**, **Git** and **Qt5** with **MinGW** in order to build the project:

```sh
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-make mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-git mingw-w64-x86_64-qt5
```

Other libraries, such as **ftxui** and **nlohmann**, are also required for compilation, but they are automatically included via CMake using the **FetchContent** feature.

**The project also requires:**

- **GCC 13** or higher
- and **C++23** support

### Compilation

The project can be compiled in **Release** or **Debug** :

```sh
make release
```

```sh
make debug
```

## Running the Game

### Launching the Program

To launch **Royal Blocks**, you can choose between two interfaces:

- Graphical interface:

  ```sh
  ./royal-blocks-gui
  ```

- Terminal interface:

  ```sh
  ./royal-blocks-tui
  ```

To start the server, run:

```sh
./royal-blocks-server
```

### Choosing the IP and Port

To establish communication between the client and the server:

#### Server

You can specify a custom port as an argument when launching the server:

```sh
./royal-blocks-server <port>
```

If no argument is provided, the server will read the **SERVER_PORT** environment variable.
If the variable is not set, the default port **1234** will be used.

#### Client

In both the graphical and terminal interfaces, you can modify the server's IP and port directly.
These settings will be saved in the configuration file:

- `~/.config/royal-blocks/config.json` on Linux

- `%APPDATA%\royal-blocks\config.json` on Windows

If no configuration file exists, a default one will be automatically created using:

- the IP address defined by the **SERVER_IP** environment variable (or **127.0.0.1** by default),
- and the port defined by **SERVER_PORT** (or **1234** by default).

### Important Information About Terminal Display

If you can't see all game information on the screen, you may need to **zoom out** in your terminal window.
